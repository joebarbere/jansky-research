# Changelog

All notable changes to `jansky-research` are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project follows
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) as codified in [`VERSIONING.md`](VERSIONING.md).

Every PR adds an entry to `## [Unreleased]`. `scripts/next_version.py` reads that section to
recommend the next version number.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `plans/85-bl3i-atlas-drift-reproduction.md` — new slice plan: independent reproduction of the
  Breakthrough Listen 3I/ATLAS GBT nondetection (RNAAS arXiv:2512.19763) from the public
  `bldata.berkeley.edu/ATLAS` archive, reusing the plan-11 `driftsearch` machinery. GATE 0 done
  in-plan (data verified public with sizes/layout; novelty pass: no independent reanalysis of
  the released data exists — ATA/FAST/MeerKAT follow-ups are all original observations).
- `src/jansky_research/atlas3i.py` + `tests/test_atlas3i.py` — the plan-85 tool: archive-index
  parser and ABACAD cadence selector (validated against a vendored real GB_ATLAS listing),
  bandpass normalisation with DC-spike excision (the artifact that defeated plan 11's teaching
  detector on real BL data), a physical-units (Hz/s) brute-force de-Doppler search with robust
  per-drift S/N and neighbour suppression, the ABACAD on/off sky-localisation filter, a
  narrowband EIRP limit that reproduces the paper's ~100 mW headline from GBT L-band
  parameters, and a fully offline synthetic-cadence round-trip (`run`) that recovers an
  injected drifting tone while rejecting always-on RFI and the DC spike. Real-data leg
  (`--node`, network + `voyager` extra) streams each 10 GB fine-resolution file in bounded
  frequency chunks and deletes scans after searching (peak disk ≈ one cadence). The node→band
  mapping (L: blc21–26 = 939–2064 MHz, etc.) was pinned by remote HDF5 header reads and is
  embedded as constants.

## [1.0.1] — 2026-07-25

### Changed

- **Install: a single clone now works.** The `jansky` dependency defaults to its pinned git tag
  (`v0.2.0`) in `[tool.uv.sources]` instead of the `../jansky` path source, so `git clone && uv sync`
  succeeds with no sibling checkout — removing a JOSS review-checklist blocker and the most likely
  first-run failure for new users. Cross-repo development is now an explicit opt-in:
  `eval "$(make -s dev-env)"` puts a sibling `../jansky/src` on `PYTHONPATH` ahead of the pinned tag
  (`uv run` preserves `PYTHONPATH`; a `uv pip install -e` overlay does *not* survive, because
  `uv run` re-syncs the environment). CI/paper/release workflows drop their second
  `actions/checkout`, so CI installs exactly what a stranger gets.
  Docs updated: `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `REPRODUCING.md`, `docs/usage.md`,
  `joss/SUBMISSION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`.
- Documentation: added the Zenodo DOI badge (concept DOI `10.5281/zenodo.21482378`) to the README
  following the v1.0.0 release.
- Documentation: added community guidelines for JOSS review — `CONTRIBUTING.md` (how to contribute,
  report issues, and get support; dev setup; the slice pattern; the pre-PR checks),
  `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` (Contributor Covenant 2.1), and `docs/usage.md` (a short install-and-run
  guide). Linked from the README.
- JOSS paper (`joss/paper.md`): added a substantial-effort paragraph to the Statement of need
  (breadth across domains + the dual Snakemake/Airflow reproducibility layer + "the software is
  itself the research"). Refreshed the stale "twenty-six slices" tally → "forty slices plus a
  synthesis" in the README Results header and `CLAUDE.md` (the slice table has 41 rows).
- Papers now cite the toolkit: the `vgpra` and `spectra` RNAAS notes `\software{}`-cite
  **`jansky-research`** via its Zenodo concept DOI `10.5281/zenodo.21482378` (new `@misc{janskyresearch}`
  `refs.bib` entry). Added a related-work disclosure to `joss/paper.md` (the two notes are in
  preparation for RNAAS, distinct from the software paper), and recorded the "cite jansky-research
  going forward" convention in `CLAUDE.md` and the `research-publish` skill.
- `research-publish` skill: the readiness check now **auto-discovers every `papers/*/rnaas.tex`**
  note (was hardcoded to `frbstats`) with a per-note 1000-word sanity check, so `vgpra`/`spectra`
  and any future note are covered without editing the script.
- Added `joss/SUBMISSION.md` — a paste-ready helper for the manual JOSS submission (form fields,
  the comments-to-editor text with the substantial-effort + related-work + AI-use disclosures, a
  verified suggested-reviewers shortlist, and RNAAS Editorial-Manager cover text).
- Added `docs/faq.md` — how others use the toolkit (depend, don't fork), how the in-repo papers work
  (authorship, provenance/priority via Zenodo DOIs, what "unpublished" does and doesn't mean), and a
  licensing note. Linked from the README and `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- **Dual-licensed the repository:** the papers in `papers/` are now **CC BY 4.0** (new
  `papers/LICENSE`); the code remains **MIT**. README, `docs/faq.md` updated to state it.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-07-21

**Initial public release.** With no prior tag this records the full toolkit as it stands rather
than a diff from an earlier version; every later section is a diff from its predecessor.

### Added

- The `jansky-research` toolkit — ~40 self-contained, reproducible research slices (a tested tool
  → real public data → adversarial science-review gate → honest AASTeX write-up), grouped by
  domain:
  - *FRB & time-domain* — `frbstats`, `frbperiod`, `frbwait`, `frblens`, `singlepulse`;
  - *Pulsars* — `pulsarspec`, `ppdot`, `pte2`, `glitchpop`, `wdpulsar`;
  - *HI & spectral line* — `hi`, `fashienv`;
  - *Solar & heliospheric* — `solarbursts`, `windwaves`, `swaves`, `triangulate`,
    `type3synthesis`, `typeii`, `ecallisto_census`, `ecallisto_catalog`, `rfitrend`;
  - *Planetary radio* — `junodam`, `skr`, `vgpra`;
  - *RM / Faraday & cosmology* — `rmsky`, `rmstructure`, `rmdipole`;
  - *Continuum & variability* — `vlass`, `vlbi`, `stacking`, `sourcecounts`, `peaked`,
    `southern`, `spectra`, `offsets`, `stokesv`, `stokesv_discovery`, `lpt`, `lptv`;
  - *SETI* — `driftsearch`;
  - *GPU / ML* — `fdmt` + `torchdsp` (device-portable pure-PyTorch DSP), `svsbi`
    (neural simulation-based inference).
- The shared slice scaffolding in `src/jansky_research/`: `data.py`, `pipeline.py`, `report.py`.
- Reproducibility paths: `make reproduce`, the Snakemake static-slice file-DAG
  (`workflow/Snakefile`, `make figures`), and the Airflow streaming e-Callisto ingest
  (`airflow/`).
- Publishing / data helpers under `.claude/skills/`: `arxiv-submit`, `casda-cutout-fetch`,
  `pull-station-data` (the `jansky-observe` rooftop-station bridge).
- **Release-versioning infrastructure** — `VERSIONING.md` (SemVer policy for this repo),
  this `CHANGELOG.md`, and `scripts/next_version.py` (recommends the next version from the
  `Unreleased` section, with its reasoning).
- `papers/vgpra/rnaas.tex` — an RNAAS short-form of the Voyager 2 PRA ice-giant rotation-period
  reanalysis (the recover-a-known → controlled-null showcase).
- `papers/spectra/rnaas.tex` — an RNAAS short-form showing raw TGSS×NVSS ultra-steep-spectrum
  selection is dominated by the TGSS flux-scale systematic (the "apparent signal is a
  systematic" cautionary note).

### Changed

- Optional GPU acceleration (`fdmt`, `sbi` extras, and the `torchdsp` slice) is pure-PyTorch and
  ROCm/CUDA-portable; the core install and CI remain CPU-only, GPU is opt-in.
- Refreshed the JOSS paper (`joss/paper.md` + `paper.bib`), `CITATION.cff`, and `.zenodo.json` to
  the current scope: "CPU-first with optional GPU" (was the false "CPU-only"), a domain-grouped
  capability list over the full >40-slice toolkit (was a stale six-module snapshot), and a
  Statement of need reframed around recover-a-known + honest-null at scale.
